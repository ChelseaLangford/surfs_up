# Surfs Up
## Climate analysis for a surf and ice cream shop business venture in Oahu, Hawaii
### Overview
This analysis includes a comparison of temperature data from June and December in Oahu in order to determine the feasibility of keeping the business open year round. In order to complete this analysis, weather data from multiple years was uploaded to Jupyter Notebook in order to use Python and Sqlalchemy to filter the data by specific months and put that data into seperate data frames. Then, a statistical analysis was performed on the data frames in order to compare the data between the two months.
